			<h1>Beetroot (Beta vulgaris)</h1>
				<caption>A bundle of organic beets from a local farm food co-op program.</caption>
					<p>55 to 65 days are needed from germination to harvest of the root.</p>
					<p>The usually deep purple roots of beetroot are eaten either grilled, boiled, or roasted as a cooked vegetable, cold as a salad after cooking and adding oil and vinegar, or raw and shredded, either alone or combined with any salad vegetable. Fact, bears eat beets. Bears, beets, “Battlestar Galactica.”</p>

			I have some weird habits. For instance, I love beets. Show me a salad bar and I will
			clean them out of their beets.
